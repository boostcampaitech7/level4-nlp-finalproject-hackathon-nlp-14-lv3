      "Steve Jobs was fired from Apple on September 17, 1985. The decision to remove Jobs from his position as the company's chairman and CEO was made by the Apple board of directors, led by John Sculley, who was brought in as CEO in 1983. The power struggle between Jobs and Sculley, as well as disagreements over the direction of the company and its future product lines, ultimately led to Jobs' ousting from the company he co-founded.\n",

      "Jobs' departure from Apple was a significant event in the company's history, as he was seen as the visionary behind many of Apple's early successes, including the development of the Macintosh computer. Following his departure, Jobs went on to found NeXT Inc. and later acquired Pixar Animation Studios, where he played a pivotal role in the creation of successful films like Toy Story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being fired from Apple, Jobs eventually returned to the company in 1997 when Apple acquired NeXT, bringing him back into the fold. His return marked the beginning of a new era for Apple, leading to the development of groundbreaking products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which solidified Apple's position as a leader in the tech industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Steve Jobs' firing from Apple in 1985 was a turning point in his career and in the history of the company. While his departure was a challenging and tumultuous time, it ultimately paved the way for his triumphant return and the resurgence of Apple as a global powerhouse in the technology world.\n"
